# **Gas Tank** ⛽
To secure the network and all the user and community funds the Habitat rollup needs Gas to operate. Like a pre-paid phone the user tops up its balance to interact with all features, modules and functionalities. A 1% top-up fee is taken and distributed among all HBT stakers/deposits.

> Rollup Balance and Gas Balance are two different components/metrics.

After depositing HBT on the rollup, users need to deposit a small amount of HBT into the “Gas Tank”. This extra balance is responsible to pay the gas cost for users in HBT. Currently 1 HBT pays ≈ 10 transactions.

#### **Please Remember:**
**The Gas Tank Balance is a tribute/payment to the Operator, you can't withdraw the deposited funds once they are on your balance, please top-up carefully!**
