> Withdrawals are requested for each token individually.

#### **Please Remember:**
When leaving the rollup, some necessary security measures are taken. Withdrawals are subject to a 7 day inspection period before users can exit.

A minimum of 7 days is recommended at the moment, so anyone can challenge the recorded history of transactions on the rollup and dispute the outcomes if necessary. In case of disputes, up to 3 weeks apply for full resolution of the challenge.
