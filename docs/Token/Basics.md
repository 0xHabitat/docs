# Token Basics 📊 

##### **Habitat is the first rollup that is governed and grown by its people and their communities.**

Therefore, the HBT token is designed to strengthen the security of the rollup infrastructure and to incentivize staking, farming and building of new governance + rollup features.

## 🛠️ **Utility of HBT**

#### **1. Feature Farming 🌱**
Communities use HBT to signal the most needed features and gov tools. Implementation of community-led upgrades increases the value of the Habitat platform and HBT.

#### **2. Ecosystem Currency 🌺**
Habitat is based on a circular economy. Builders, stakers, and active voters can earn while users and communities pay in HBT for rollup operator fees and new features.

#### **3. Rollup Governance 🏗**
When HBT and ETH are staked you earn the right to vote on important rollup design decisions. This can include challenge times, block finalizations, operator fees, and many more rollup-specific governance parameters.

#### **4. Operator Rewards 💸**
All the rewards and profits of the rollup go towards the liquidity providers and HBT-ETH stakers on Habitat. Communities should not only benefit by low transaction fees or fast confirmation times but also by the very own profit Habitat generates.

## 🫐 **Token Supply**

**The total supply of HBT is capped at 100.000.000 Habitat Token**

**84% = 84.000.000 HBT** are fully locked and can only be unlocked via governance once the bootstrapping phase ends.

To ensure high security and no initial drain or rug pull only **0.5%** can be unlocked per week. When no proposal is passed this rate will accumulate to allow bigger funding opportunities.

### **Bootstrap Phase**

An initial supply of **2.000.000** was released during the bootstrapping phase of Habitat, which started on **10th March 2021**.

During this fair launch, everyone could directly swap any ERC-20 token to HBT and the swap happened at a fixed rate of **0.25 DAI = 1 HBT**.

#### **IDO & Liquidity**
There will be pre-defined proposals to unlock HBT for IDO and liquidity providers - the community is making the last call whether or not to initiate those proposals.

## 🌞 **Genesis Team**

The genesis team are vesting their total cut of **9% over 3 years.**

For future hires, operator fees and marketing/communication an additional **5% will be vested.**

All funds will be dropped to and send out by a multi-signature wallet.

## 📡 **Token Distribution**

The overview shows a detailed distribution of the HBT token, the process will be facilitated by pre-deployed [Droplet Contracts](Droplets.md), which drip the 0.5% over a fixed period of time towards the assigned wallets and contracts.
