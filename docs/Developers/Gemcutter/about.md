## EIP-2535 Diamonds simplified

Gemcutter is a set of [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) tasks built to provide a simple way to develop and deploy EIP-2535 Diamonds. It uses a file to sync the local changes to the blockchain.


## Sourcify verification
Gemcutter works with [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/), all the deployed facets are going to be verified on Sourcify.

## The Diamond file

Gemcutter uses **.diamond.json** files to keep track of the status of the diamond.
It is composed by:
* **address**: the address of the diamond
* **chainId**: the chainId of the diamond (check Sourcify chainId)
* **functionSelectors**: a mapping (function_name: facet_name)
* **contracts**: all the facets in the diamond

You can have multiple **.diamond.json** files into a single project. When calling the Gemcutter's hardhat tasks pass the **--o** argument to specify the **.diamond.json**.

### Contracts type: remote vs local

Contracts type can be:
* **remote**: already deployed contracts verified on Sourcify
* **local**: contracts that are going to be deployed
