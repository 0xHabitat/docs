## Bounties
This policy allows to write out rewards to complete required tasks. Completed tasks are payed by the Habitat keyholders to the claiming member.

#### How to create a new bounty?
Create an issue with bounty description and a bounty tag in an appropriate repository. see: [Habitat Github](https://github.com/0xHabitat/habitat/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bounty&template=Bounty.md&title=)

Communicate the bounty to the organisation by submitting the bounty in the discord channel: "Workbench" or via the "Bounty Board".

#### Objections
Any bounty can be objected by anyone through communication channel or GitHub for 2 days after its creation.
You must clearly communicate the objection to the bounty proposer and the organisation e.g. not misunderstood as a minor comment on the issue.
In the cases where objector and proposer are not able to come to an acceptable solution, the circle’s facilitator must be involved to enact Holacracy constitution’s article “3.3.5 INTEGRATIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS” to solve the objection as a tension. Tensions are clarified in weekly tactical calls.

If the tension was integrated successfully or if there weren’t any public objections, the bounty is considered approved.

#### Roadblock/Challenges
Once a bounty is assigned, the worker is asked to start working immediately on the issue. If the worker feels blocked in execution, he/she has to communicate the tensions to the gardener. Only if tensions are not reported and the bounty get's no further attention, anyone can challenge the bounty or takeover.

Bounties should be delivered within time, even if work is left to be performed. Leftover work can be tackled by submitting a new bounty with support by the organisation.
Bounty forking: complexity of bounties that has been undersized can be forked out by a new bounty submission.

#### Bounty sizes
Described are ranges from minimum to maximum payout, each gardener can define the full size of the bounty individually. Ranges are open for negotiation between gardener & worker.

to be defined upon creation of the Bounty: Size / Range / Currency
