DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

The Habitat DAO is inviting interested workers to contribute with their hard skills to the development of the Habitat application and the Habitat Smart Contracts. But not only code can be proposed: Content Creators, Business Developers and Project Managers can also propose work to be done, organising the work, create awareness and provide value for other community members.

DAO Members/Contributors can contribute where they see the need and fit. Most current tasks are defined by the scope for Prototype and Habitat v2 MVP.

Please check our Roadmap to get an idea of the current state:

Tasks within the Habitat DAO are proposed as Bounties. These bounties include a fixed scope and workload. Once completed, the required tasks are rewarded through payments. Bounties can be objected by other contributors and team members. Bounties can be completed in pair-programming or joint ventures.

Completed Work is reviewed by other team-members/ contributors and will be included into the process once successful.

Learn more about the current contributor flow and the creation/completion of Bounties on the next pages -->
