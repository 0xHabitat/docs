The current simple onboarding flow can be described as follows:
1. Join the [Habitat Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nxDZ7F27ba).
2. Introduce yourself in the #intro channel and claim the "Contributor" Role.
3. Join one of the check-in calls or the tactical call happening each Thursday at 4:00 PM CET in Discord.
4. Get familiar with the Habitat Github or scroll the #bounty-board channel in discord and see where your skillset can be helpful.
5. Review other Bounties or create your own.
6. Get the work done and get paid :)
